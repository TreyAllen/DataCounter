# DataCounter
Custom JavaFX Application that allows the user to keep a running tally of the type of work done during the day.<br>
At the end of the day, this information is then transferred by the user to a separate tracking spreadsheet.<br>

Clicking + or - buttons increase or decrease the tally.  <br>
The tally field is editable so the user can manually input a value in this field if necessary. <br>
If the field contains a non-numeric value, the +/- buttons will not work.<br>
The tally can increase as much as needed, but it will not go negative.<br>
Clicking the red Reset button resets the value back to 0.<br>
